# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Data set can be downloaded either from Kaggle or from the file uploaded in the repository
First, we analyse the data set and the data cleaning and processing is done.
Later we check for missing values and Handle them accordingly.
Now, we visualise the data using seaborn library.
We can do multiple visualisations using more than 1 coulumns.
Finally, we train 80% of the data and test the remaining 20%.
Then we check for the accuracy score.
As long as the accuracy score is 75%, we can use the model.
This way, we can predict the number of people Survived on the Titanic using the given data.
